## Introduction

I created this project over the course of two months to deepen my understanding of meshes and their manipulation as part of my learning process. Currently, I am in my second semester of studying game development, and this project is a reflection of my progress and passion for the field.

This demo is part of my portfolio as I pursue a career in game development. Feel free to explore the project, review the code, and provide feedback. Your input is greatly appreciated!

## Technologies
- **Unity**: For the game engine and development environment.
- **C#**: For scripting and implementing mesh deformation logic.

## Setup
In order to run the Mesh Deformation demo project, make sure you have the following
- Unity 2022.3.10f

## Illustrations

## Features
- **Real-Time Deformation**: Demonstrates how meshes can be deformed at runtime.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to interact with and manipulate the mesh in real-time.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust deformation parameters to see different effects.

## Example of Use

### Viewing the Demo
1. Open the `Marcel_Rei_Mesh_Deformation_Demo` scene to see the demo in action.

### Customizing Deformation Shape
1. Assign a prefab to the Paremeter DeformerToSpawn at the CreateDeformerScript in the Inspector, and the deformation will conform to its mesh

### Making a Mesh Deformable
1. Select the object with the mesh you want to deform.
2. Add the `MeshDeformationScript` to the object.
3. Tag the object as `Deformable`.

### Deforming the Mesh
There are two ways to deform the mesh:

1. **Using the PlayerMeshDeform Prefab:**
    - Drag and drop the `PlayerMeshDeform` prefab into your scene.
    - Play the scene and left-click while looking at the mesh to see the deformation.

2. **Using the CreateDeformerScript:**
    - Add the `CreateDeformerScript` to an existing object in your scene.
    - Play the scene and left-click while looking at the mesh to create a deformation based on where you are looking.

## Project Status

While I am not actively working on this project at the moment, I am proud of what I have accomplished. This technical demo of runtime mesh deformation in Unity allowed me to deepen my understanding of mesh manipulation techniques. Through this project, I successfully implemented real-time mesh deformation features, enhancing my skills in Unity and C# programming.

Looking ahead, I am focused on further advancing my knowledge in game development, particularly in areas like graphics, shaders and optimization techniques. While mesh deformation remains a topic of interest, I am eager to explore new challenges and expand my skill set.

I am open to revisiting and improving this project in the future as my skills evolve. Each project like this one is a stepping stone towards my goal of securing a position within the game industry, where I can contribute my passion and expertise to creating engaging and immersive gaming experiences.
